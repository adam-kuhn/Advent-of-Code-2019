# Advent-of-Code-2019
My attemp at Advent of Code 2019. It's been ~ 1 year since I've started my career as a developer. Let's see how far I can make it.
...Day 8 :)
I'm fine with that. It was getting a little too time consuming and I'm ready for the holidays...but it was fun while it lasted, till next year.
